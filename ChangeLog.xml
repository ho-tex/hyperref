<ENTRY date="2012-11-06" version="6.83m" by="&HO;">
* 6.83m
* Option `pdflang': Default is `\relax' that suppresses
  the entry in the PDF catalogue. An empty value (undetermined
  language) is written to the PDF catalogue.
* Option `pdflang': Checks for well-formedness added
  (if \pdfmatch is available).
* Option `hyperindex': The latest encapsulating command is repeated
  for the close range entries, if it is not already given. That improves
  compatibility to `xindy'. (Formatting commands remain unsupported.)

</ENTRY>

<ENTRY date="2012-10-13" version="6.83j" by="&HO;">

</ENTRY>

<ENTRY date="2012-10-11" version="6.83h" by="&HO;">
* 6.83h
* If `hyperref' is loaded in the document class, then it misses
  the detection of package `tex4ht' of `htlatex' because it is
  loaded after the documentclass. Therefore another test for
  `\HCode' is added that is defined by `htlatex'.
* The setting of additional information entries is done globally
  like the other standard options (pdfauthor, pdftitle, ...)
  for the information dictionary. (Bug report:
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/75684/16967)

  The strings are already in UTF16, thus an additional conversion

  is at begin of document or first page (driver dependant).
* XeTeX has its own driver file `hxetex.def' (based on hdvipdfm.def).

  the formatting command in its first argument with the page range
  as argument that is put into \hyperpage. The formatting command

* \@ifnextchar because of \futurelet disabled.
* Disabling of \@ifstar removed, because it calls \@ifnextchar.
* \@protected@testopt disabled to show the problematic macro in
  the warning message (commands with an optional argument).
* \pdfstringdefWarn#1 prints a warning message with token #1,
  it can be used in code that disables macros by the user.
* \pdfstringdefDisableCommands#1 is a easier interface for
  the hook \pdfstringdefPreHook. It appends its argument to the
  meaning of \pdfstringdefPreHook. The character @ can be used
  in command names.
* \penalty is removed silently.
* \kern and \hskip are detected with a warning:
  * At the beginning or, if the value is less than 1ex,
    they are removed.
  * Else they are replaced by a space.

Fix for \pdfpage(s)attr:
* Setting the /CropBox with \pdfpagesattr:
  The old meaning of \pdfpagesattr is appended.
* Initial value of \@pdfpagestransition is \relax
  to differentiate between a unused or empty option.
* \hyper@pagetransition (hpdftex):
  * The old entry /Trans is removed from \pdfpageattr.
  * The remaining old meaning retains and
  * the new /Trans is appended.
* \hyper@pagetransition (pdfmark):
  * \if-switch for \relax added to get the old behaviour.

* PD1 encoding

  bug report few weeks ago in pdftex@tug.org).

  so things like "\TeX{}" can be written.
* With this version of \Hy@PDFDef the option exactdef can be
  removed now because of the warning messages.
* All non-expandible commands like unknown glyphs or stomach
  commands are catched by this version: a comprehensive
  warning message is produced and the tokens are removed.
* xspace support.
* Support for unbalanced parentheses, hyparen.sty is now obsolete.

  *something* (ie a \cite inside a \caption gave the destination of
  the cite to the caption)

  incompatibility with ps2pdf
